      <p>Ryomen Sukuna, more often called just Sukuna, is a mighty cursed spirit known as the undisputed King of Curses.<br/> He serves as one of the primary antagonists of Jujutsu Kaisen.<br/>
      <p>According to a legend, during the golden age of jujutsu over 1,000 years ago, Sukuna was an Imaginary Demon, though in truth was a human sorcerer, and other sorcerers gave their all to defeat him.<br/>After his death, he became a cursed spirit, and his curse was too strong for his body to be fully destroyed.<br/>Henceforth, his remains of 20 indestructible fingers, preserved in grave wax, traversed the ages as cursed objects, ever growing in power.<br/>In the present, Sukuna has been incarnated into Yuji Itadori due to the latter eating one of his cursed fingers, which contain his fragmented power.
